## Description

Scholarly Communication has evolved significantly in recent years, with an increasing focus on **Open Research**, [FAIR](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) data sharing and community-developed open source methods. The concepts of _authorship_ and _citation_ are changing, as researchers are increasingly reusing and evolving common software tools and datasets. Yet with a growing amount of cloud compute power and open platforms available, **reproducibility** of computational analyses becomes more challenging, and not yet commonly included in peer review. While recent advances in scientific **workflows** and **provenance** capture systems have improved on this situation, a question remains on how to _publish, archive, explore_ _and understand _digital research outputs, as academic authors and publishers remain focused on PDFs and the occasional CSV file, with the Web and Open Research often left to "best effort" rather than being the expected norm.

A number of community initiatives have begun to explore how to package various multi-part research outcomes with their context, how to handle distributed and living content and how to port and safely exchange these "**Research Objects**" between platform and between researchers.

One such approach is [Research Object](http://www.researchobject.org/) which has proposed a way to _package_ and _describe_ research outputs, data, methods, workflows, provenance and structured metadata, reusing existing Web standards and formats. Research Objects, and Research Object-like approaches have gathered pace across:

* Scientific domains - bioinformatics, systems biology (e.g. [COMBINE](http://co.mbine.org/documents/archive) Archives), health informatics (e.g. [BioComputeObject](https://osf.io/h59uh/));
* Tasks - handling big data ([BDBags](http://bd2k.ini.usc.edu/tools/bdbag/)), reproducible workflows ([Common Workflow Language](http://www.commonwl.org/)), scholarly communication and publishing ([Dryad](https://datadryad.org/), [dataONE](https://www.dataone.org/));
* Platforms:
  * Virtual Research Environments, e.g. the [EVER-EST](http://ever-est.eu/) VRE for Earth Sciences;
  * Community output aggregators such as the EU's [OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/), [FAIRDOMHub](https://fairdomhub.org/), [CodeOcean](https://codeocean.com/) and [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/).
* Stakeholders
  * Publishers - such as eLife's [Reproducible Document Stack](https://elifesciences.org/labs/7dbeb390/reproducible-document-stack-supporting-the-next-generation-research-article) project and [science.ai](https://science.ai/), 
  * Repository providers such a [dataONE](https://www.dataone.org/) and [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/) and [Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com); 
  * Funders, such as the EU ([European Open Science Cloud](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/european-open-science-cloud)) and NIH (e.g. [Data Commons](https://commonfund.nih.gov/bd2k/commons))

However, many challenges remain as to how to increase Research Object uptake with data providers, researchers, infrastructures, publishers and other stakeholders; credit and tracking metrics; develop supporting tooling; building effective community efforts and the relationship of rich metadata manifests with emerging container platforms.

In this workshop, following on from the successful [RO2018](http://www.researchobject.org/ro2018/) held at eScience 2018, we will explore recent advancements in Research Objects and publishing of research data. 

This workshop aims for a mix of presentation sessions and "unconferencing" sessions including:

*   Keynotes and invited talks
*   Presentations selected from short article submissions and extended abstracts
*   Demonstrations and (informal) poster session
*   5-minute Lightning talks for ad-hoc presentations and hot topics
*   ~1 hour break-out sessions to further build relationships across scientific domains and RO practitioners.

## Submit

Submissions are welcome for **Short articles** (about 4-8 pages), **Abstracts** for oral communication (1-2 pages) and **Poster and demo abstracts** (1-2 pages)

RO2019 encourages _open peer review_, and recommend that reviewers are named and attributed; however reviewers may be anonymous if so desired.

Please see our [submission guide](submitting) for details, then either:

* [Submit via GitHub](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro2019/issues/new/choose) -or-
* [Submit via EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ro2019)

Carole Goble heads [researchobject.org](http://www.researchobject.org) along with her team in the [eScience Lab](http://www.esciencelab.org.uk/) at the University of Manchester, whose mission is to disseminate knowledge about research objects, their concept and their adoption. She has spent 25 years working in e-Science on computational workflows, reproducible science, open sharing, and knowledge and metadata management in a range of disciplines. 

She co-established the [myExperiment.org](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkq429) workflow repository and the [FAIRDOMHub.org](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkw1032) for systems biology asset sharing. She is the co-lead of the interoperability platform for [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org/), the EU Research Infrastructure for Life Sciences,  Head of Node of ELIXIR-UK and co-founder of the UK's Software Sustainability Institute. She has keynoted twice for IEEE e-Science (2005, 2012). In 2008 she was honoured by Microsoft Jim Gray award for outstanding contributions to eScience.
