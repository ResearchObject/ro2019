# Proceedings of Workshop on Research Objects (RO2019)


The below articles and abstracts were reviewed to be accepted for [RO2019](/ro2019/) following the [call for contributions](ro2019/cfp). <!-- See also the [schedule](/ro2019/schedule/) for the corresponding talks. -->

RO2019 encouraged _open peer review_, and recommend that reviewers are named and attributed; however reviewers may be anonymous if so desired. Reviews will be added to this page later.

* Accepted contributions announced


## Articles

_Research papers were accepted for [talks](/ro2019/schedule/) at RO2019 and will be published in the [IEEE eScience 2019](https://escience2019.sdsc.edu/) official [conference proceedings](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=1001511 )._

Publications in the _IEEE eScience 2019 proceedings_ are not Open Access. To encourage [Green Open Access](http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/using-the-library/staff/research/services/open-access-at-manchester/understanding-open-access/#d.en.403436) before that we recommend paper authors post their _camera-ready version_ on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) or their institutional preprint server according to [IEEE's article sharing policies](https://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/publish-with-ieee/author-education-resources/guidelines-and-policies/policy-posting-your-article/). Below preprints links to the _author-submitted_ version; note that these may be updated for a _camera ready_ version.
