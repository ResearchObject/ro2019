# Open Peer Reviews

RO2019 encourages _open peer review_, and recommend that reviewers are named and attributed; however reviewers may be anonymous if so desired. 

See also [review template](/reviews/template) and [reviews by GitHub](https://github.com/researchobject/ro2019/issues).

_**Note:** The list of peer reviews is currently under construction, as reviews are transcribed manually from EasyChair_

The [Call for Papers](https://researchobject.github.io/ro2019/cfp) was announced through EasyChair, Twitter, organizational and project websites, multiple mailing lists and newsletters, at related workshop presentations, in the [RO-Crate](https://researchobject.github.io/ro-crate/) calls and to the [RO2019 Programme Committee](/ro2019/#program-committee).

Announcements were sent out roughly at:

* 2019-05-25 ("first call")

* 2019-07-04 ("final call")

Existing contacts in projects, [eScience 2019 organizers](https://escience2019.sdsc.edu/organizers) and [eScience 2019 programme committee](https://escience2019.sdsc.edu/pc) were approached personally and invited to submit for peer review.


## Submissions

Submissions were received through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ro2019) or [GitHub](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro2019/issues).

Received submissions:

* 4 EasyChair articles
* 8 EasyChair abstracts
* 3 GitHub abstracts

In the [submission guide](/ro2019/submitting), authors were requested to deposit their abstract or article to the [Zenodo ResearchObject community](https://zenodo.org/communities/ro) and only include the DOI/URL to Zenodo in the EasyChair/GitHub submission.

* 12 submissions had Zenodo preprint link/DOI
* ..of which 9 submissions were added to the RO Community in Zenodo
* 2 submissions had only PDF in EasyChair
* 1 submission had only text in EasyChair


## Reviewers

After the extended deadline, EasyChair was opened for bidding, where 8 of the PC members indicated papers they preferred to review, being assigned _on average_ 1.4 "Yes" bids papers and 1.0 "Maybe"/"No" papers. 8 assignments were given to PC or chair members who did not bid.

_(Table adapted from EasyChair, one row per randomized PC member)_

Each submission was assigned to 2 members of the [RO2019 programme committee](/ro2019/#program-committee), with additional assignments if PC members were at risk of unresponsiveness. The chairs added fall-back reviews if PC members did not respond by deadline.

The decision per submission was done by silent consensus by individual chairs where reviews where consistent. One submission was discussed further and authors requested to revise before acceptance.
