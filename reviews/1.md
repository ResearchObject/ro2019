* good (_followed guidelines, demonstrating own format, related resources included, but some details missing_)

## Overall evaluation
_Please provide a brief review, including a justification for your scores. 
Both score and  review text are required._

* accept

The authors provide a compelling project that will allow creation of a unified standard for data capture and metadata reporting across diverse types of biological data. This will be done through the use of BIDs standard format for Research Objects.

### Major comments

1. It will be great if the authors could evaluate BioCompute Objects which also has similar goals <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30596645> <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27974626> <https://biocomputeobject.org/specification.html>
2. The title needs to be reworded. Maybe make it more generic? It does not mean anything to someone who is not familiar with BID and the cited projects.

### Minor comment
3. The abstract seems to be a collection of thoughts. It is quite hard to read. Spell out acronyms the first time it is used.

Is it clear what is the author's contribution?_

* excellent

The description of the initial BIDS work and the new SPARC-BIDS effort is clear, succinct and easy to follow. The core concepts are defined and well-referenced.

(delete as appropriate)
* strong accept

Both the BIDS and SPARC-BIDS initiatives are compelling examples of research objects which have seen relatively broad adoption in a short period of time. The experiences of this team will be of interest to participants and should usefully inform related data packaging efforts.
