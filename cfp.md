## Research Objects

Scholarly Communication has evolved significantly in recent years, with an
increasing focus on Open Research, FAIR data sharing and community-developed
open source methods. A question remains on how to publish, archive and explore
digital research outputs.

A number of initiatives have begun to explore how to package and describe
research outputs, data, methods, workflows, provenance and structured metadata,
reusing existing Web standards and formats.

Such efforts aim to address the challenges of structuring multi-part research
outcomes with their context, handling distributed and living content and
porting and safely exchange what we collectively can call “Research Objects”
between platforms and between researchers.


## Call for Papers

In the workshop RO2018 we will explore recent advancements in Research Objects
and publishing of research data with peer-reviewed presentations, invited
talks, short demos, lightning talks and break-out sessions to further build
relationships across scientific domains and RO practitioners.

RO2018 welcomes submissions of academic abstracts (1-2 pages), data/software
articles (3-6 pages) and short research articles (4-8 pages) on cross-cutting
case studies or specific research on topics including, but not limited to:

  FAIR metrics; platforms, infrastructure and tools; lifecycles; access control
  and secure exchange; examples of exploitation and application; executable
  containers; metadata, packaging and formats; credit, attribution and peer
  review; dealing with scale and distribution; driving adoption within current
  scholarly communications and alignments with community efforts; and
  domain-specific and cross-domain Research Objects.

## Submitting

Submitted abstracts and articles can be in a range of open formats (e.g. HTML,
ePub) and are particularly encouraged to be submitted in a FAIR research data
packing format.

Accepted abstracts and articles will be included in the IEEE eScience 2018
proceedings. Submitted preprints will, upon acceptance, be made available as
Green Open Access on the RO2018 website with DOI links to the Zenodo record and
(eventually) the published IEEE proceeding article.

It is a requirement that at least one author of each accepted submission
attends the RO2018 workshop at the IEEE eScience 2018 conference, where
registration fees applies.

RO2018 encourages open peer review, and recommend that reviewers
are named and attributed; however reviewers may be anonymous if so
desired. Reviewers are welcome to publish their reviews using the
same guidelines as the research articles.
